# VIBECHECK

## Requirements:

Make sure to have installed Yarn before proceeding

To do this:

Run `brew install yarn`,

Run `choco install yarn`,

or visit https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable

There are two parts to this repository: a React web app in `/vibecheck-client` and a Flask web server in `/vibecheck-server`.

### MySQL Database

By default, the Flask server is set up to work with a database that's locally hosted and accessed with a passwordless root account. If you'd like to change this, edit the URI that is assigned to `app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI']` in `station.py`.

Additionally, you can add a password to the root account if you'd like. Just keep in mind that you'll have to add `:[PASSWORD]`
after the username in the MySQL URI.

First, install MySQL on your computer if you don't have it.

macOS: `brew install mysql`
Windows: `choco install mysql`

Both of these sources set the root account of the locally-hosted MySQL server to be passwordless by default.

Now, start up a local MySQL server with `mysql.server start` or `"C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.7\bin\vibecheck_db"` if using Powershell. On the first run of this server, you'll need to follow some
extra steps. Otherwise, you're done! You can stop the server with `mysql.server stop` or move forward with starting the Flask server.

If this is the first time the MySQL server's been run, you'll want to run `mysql -u root` to access the MySQL monitor. Then,
run the instruction `CREATE DATABASE vibecheck_db;`, semicolon and upper/lower case included.

Now that the database has been created, run `exit`. The server will still be runnning and you can now start the Flask server.  

If you're experiencing a Flask error relating to the DB, you'll likely need to delete vibecheck_db's user_search table and let flask reinitialize it.  

To do this from the command line, run `mysql -u root`, then `connect vibecheck_db;`, then `DROP TABLE user_search;`



### Web Server

First, `cd` into `vibecheck/vibecheck-server`; then set up the Python virtual environment with `python3 -m venv venv`.

Then, launch the virtual environment:

For Mac: `source venv/bin/activate`  

For Windows: `source venv/Scripts/activate` (Git Bash) or `.\venv\Scripts\activate` (cmd)

While the venv is active, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
and to get the required NLTK modules run `python -m nltk.downloader stopwords punkt averaged_perceptron_tagger`

Run `pip install python-dotenv` to include the .flaskenv/.env files.

You should also set the environmental variable FLASK_APP to `station.py`

`export FLASK_APP=station.py` (in Bash)
`$env:FLASK_APP = "station.py"` (in Powershell)

Run `yarn start-api` to start flask localhost on Windows  
Run `yarn start-api-m` to start flask localhost on Mac

_If you need to add a new dependency, run `pip install [module]` and then run `pip freeze > requirements.txt`._

### React App
In a new terminal window:

To be able to run the React web app, you need to have `npm` installed (included with Node.js).

First, `cd` into `vibecheck/vibecheck-client`.

Run `npm install`.

Then, run `yarn start` to start the react localhost.

_If you need to add a new dependency, run `npm install [module] --save`_

### API Limits
A number of the APIs used in this project have limits on daily use because of
the user tier we're currently using. This especially applies to Reddit search,
which utilizes the Google Search API upon every request. This can be helped by
changing the API key to one associated with a developer account with more 
access, but this would cost money. Upon a proper product release, this would
be trivial, but the current behavior is suitable for the class project and is
free. If too many searches are made in one day, for Reddit especially, a search
might not complete, but the application otherwise works as intended. This
behavior will not occur upon the use of developer accounts with billing.
